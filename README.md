# Bangkit-MunculLagi
The project called "Raja Tawar" is an application developed using Kotlin as a programming language for Front End, PHP as a programming language for Back End. The main feature that we provide from this application is an auction or bidding approach in marketplace. Unlike the other, our marketplace focus on bidding feature to gain an exposure for the customers who look for product or custom product. This kind of behaviour also appear in social media like Facebook. They upload or share their desired product to facebook's seller groups, hope if they will find what they need.
